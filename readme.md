Getting started with learning python, I have never touched Python 3 before, a few goals to hit:
[X] Write a python program that prints "Hello World" to the Terminal
[X] Write a python program that makes use of variables, functions, arrays, objects, loops -- all the things!
[ ] Write an API server in python, that returns "Hello World" from a GET endpoint (Hint: use flask)
[ ] Write an API server in python, that talks to a postgres DB, and returns DB rows via a GET endpoint (Hint: use psycopg)
